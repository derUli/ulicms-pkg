 ==> [001]  Introduction

    Welcome to phpAntiVirus. In the ever-decreasing world of Internet
    security, web servers are fast becoming a target for spammers and
    authors of malicious code to spread their nasties.

    Server security is paramount, and the spread of malicious code can
    be prevented by competent administrators and knowledgable web
    masters. But why not be on the safe side?

    phpAntiVirus is designed to run on your web server and scan your
    public web files for malicious code. It is small, portable and
    efficient, uses minimal server resources, and provides a full
    report on what has been discovered.

[+]----------------------------------------------------------------------[+]

 ==> [002]  What phpAV Does NOT Do

    phpAntiVirus is not a replacement for standard anti-viral tools.
    It does not scan your e-mail, it does not scan your computer, it
    does not scan the server for malicious binaries. It does not
    act as a tripwire for *nix account takeovers.

    At the moment phpAntiVirus does not scan for vulnerabilities in
    your web site code. It merely detects any changes as a result of
    a vulnerability being abused.

    Although considered stable, it is early days for the phpAV
    project.

    Ideally phpAntiVirus should be run on your user account alongside
    the server administrators' own security tools.

 ==> [003]  Linux Installation

    Please see INSTALL for installation instructions.

[+]----------------------------------------------------------------------[+]

 ==> [004]  Windows Installation

    Please see INSTALL for installation instructions.

[+]----------------------------------------------------------------------[+]

 ==> [005]  Troubleshooting

    I get "Fatal error: Virus.def vulnerable to overwrite..."

      This means the permissions of the "virus.def" file may allow
      other users to overwrite your virus definitions, causing
      undesirable results or rendering phpAV useless.

      To fix this, read the installation instructions.


    How do I get phpAV to scan content stored in a database?

      Databases are not currently supported by phpAV. Expect this
      to change in future releases.


    Why does phpAV only scan X directory/scan too much?

      phpAV only scans the path you define during the installation
      procedure. Please read installation instructions.

      At the moment phpAV will recursively scan ALL directories in
      the path you have specified.

 ==> [006]  Getting Support

   If you are having problems installing/using your phpAV, please
   PLEASE follow this list carefully. You are bound to find an answer
   in one them. Please do not ask support a question that is already
   answered in our carefully-structured documenation, as the response
   may offend ;)


   - Documentation

     Yes - RTFM! We spent a long time compiling the documentation that
     is included with each release.


   - SourceForge Bug Reports

     If you are getting an error, please check first if it is a known
     bug. Be assured if the bug is already posted we are working as
     fast as we can to fix it, we don't need to be told twice.


   - SourceForge Support Forums

     Still unable to find an answer to your question? Post your query
     to the SourceForge support forums, where the developers and other
     users will be happy to assist.


   Please, under no circumstances, contact the developers directly for
   support. We are UNABLE to provide support by e-mail.

[+]----------------------------------------------------------------------[+]

 ==> [007]  Frequently Asked Questions

   In all honesty, we haven't received that many questions from users
   yet. As our support forums grow we will include FAQs on our website
   and future releases' documentation.

 ==> [008]  Authors

   phpAntiVirus was originally conceived and coded by KeyboardArtist.
   Since then two other developers have joined the project - Nico and
   Deekay. Murphy is our resident project manager.

   Where possible the script, documentation and official web site were
   written in nano. Thank you to the authors of nano (except for the
   segmentation fault that just deleted half this document!), figlet,
   mySQL and PHP, in fact most open source developers out there.

   And of course thank you to everyone who has submitted bug reports
   and feature requests during the lifecycle of this project. We
   wouldn't be here without you either.
